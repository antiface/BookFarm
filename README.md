The Book Farm Allegory (Nothing To Fear) - How The Radio and FDR Helped Secure The 21st Century For Good

                                                 BookFarm:
	As I sat in my own bedroom, I looked upon my bookshelf and so I asked myself, "Why is this bookshelf here, what insane longing or crazy urge caused me to place it in that exact place?".  Due to the impact of home design in our society and the anxiety of conforming to the norms of "correct bookshelf dispensing", I felt a burning desire to put my bookshelf in a corner across from my bed where there is a lamp, chair, and plenty of reading space, although I sometimes read in bed; I also found that it looked pretty nice there.

It so happens that a sofa used to occupy that area, perhaps a better question then is, "Why did I feel the urge to put a bookshelf there?".  This led me to a curious thought...

                            Society Destroyed by Faulty Book Distribution
	I was just informed, by a certain informer,  that I am in possession of a book belonging to him.  This book was borrowed by a man who felt he had the right to lend something he did not own, for I now have this book (having been lent it); under any circumstances, books which are borrowed can never be lent out by the borrower because this breaks the rule of book distribution, amendments and modalities which I shall reveal.
	I would like to state that it is with great pride and honor that I will be returning the object of false distribution, and I do feel pain in my heart upon hearing of cases such as this.  A person simply does not have the right to do as he so wishes with an object he does not own.  This book was kindly given to me and I was told that I could keep it for as long as I wanted to.  Now, I must ask, when did this person earn the right indulge in such criminal mastery?  Did he not know of his most obvious and egregious offense?  As far as I can apprehend, the book was used as a device to express this traitor's evil intentions; it was a demonstration of hatred for mankind, and maybe this contributed slightly to our society's decay.
	The responsibilities accompanied with borrowing books are numerous.  Books can attain great lengths and within them extreme amounts of knowledge and wisdom can be stored.  Perhaps people need to care more.  If the borrower was given a quick psycho-analysis, I am utterly convinced that his trustworthiness would stand out clearly.  

- people need to care more about books (and knowledge kept within).
- people need to care more about the private lives of others.
- perhaps the proprietor wishes not to have a certain person possess his book.

Look at a person's bookshelf and ye shall see his mind.  I was once with a close friend and we realized this together; that from the books on one's bookshelf, we can at least learn a lot from this person if not everything.  Therefore lending a book is lending a part of ourselves and our personal history.  My friend and I knew the power of books; we spent most of our graduating year (in high school) reading in the library.  And let me say that it was one of the greatest times in my life.  What could be better, youâ€™re with a friend doing what you like and everyone makes fun of you?
I think that the owner of the book in my mis-possession will be glad to hear that I barely looked through the book, if at all.  Perhaps, at a subconscious level, I was aware of whose book it was; maybe I had seen it before at this person's house...

I was at a garage sale and I could not believe my eyes when I saw a rack of books; how could one possibly wish to give out his books?  I realized that he must have incredible amounts of confidence in himself and trust for others; to give away our life's all...

The only reason I want to live is to appreciate art with mankind while contributing to our world's insurmountable amount of art and beauty.

If I am the composer of a book and I wish to tell everyone what I think but someone buys my book and wishes only his intimate friends to read my work, do his friends have the right to let others (strangers) read his book?

Books are immaculate.

The man was selling expensive comic-books below their true worth.

	Are we so underdeveloped that we hold no care for the self-esteem of comic-books?  If one is worth a lot, why sell it for less?  The issue here is not avarice, it is that comic-books have their own rights, as do books of all kinds.  So I ask myself, when we disallow copying of material from a book, is this in respect to the author and publishing house or does this copyright deal that we have only play on the wish of books to have their privacy kept?  The wisdom found in books is so magnificent that it may have its own wishes met.  But I ask myself again, if a book wishes to be read by a stranger, the owner wishes no one to read his book except his wife, and his wife wishes to divorce her husband, strive to have the book for herself, marry the other man (stranger) and give him the book, what happens then?

	I've had a question now for quite a while, since a friend of mine decided that it was better for us not to speak to each other (this being quite the obstacle in a relationship, but such a funny game), "If you are married to someone and you give them a book as a present, keeping in mind that you paid for the book, if you separate, whom has lawful property of this item?  Should the book not be given back to the store where it was bought?  Or perhaps to the author of the book...  But then again, I do believe that a library for books of this sort be erected in space, where all humans have equal access and the books live of their own free will.  What are we to do if these books are found by space-aliens?  Which civilization has rights to the library, us or them?  And who would the judge be?


I am a Book...
	
	...filled with knowledge and wisdom and I volunteer myself as mediator in any such occurrences: the battling of species for my brother-books.
          Heads or tails, humans?               Heads or tails, alien-beings?
(Flip a two-sided human coin, or martian equivalent, a "head" thus declaring possession of the library).  What about a library for the entire Universe to own?  (Do aliens have books?).
